The JavaScript SDK 

chain.js is a JavaScript SDK for writing applications that interact with the blockchain from either Node.js, browser, or React Native environments and provides simple abstractions over core data structures, serialization, key management, and API request generation.

## Features

- **Written in TypeScript**, with type definitions
- Versatile support for key management solutions
- Works in Node.js, in the browser, and React Native
- Exposes the API through `LCDClient`
- Parses responses into native JavaScript types

We highly suggest using chain.js with TypeScript, or JavaScript in a code editor that has support for type declarations, so you can take advantage of the helpful type hints that are included with the package.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @gnchain/chain.js
```

## Usage

chain.js can be used in Node.js, as well as inside the browser. Please check the docs for notes on how to get up and running.
